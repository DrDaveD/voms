.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The voms\-proxy\-fake generates a proxy containing arbitrary attributes without contacting the VOMS server\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
Options may be specified indifferently with either a "\-" or "\-\-" prefix\&.

.PP
\fB\-help\fR Displays usage\&.

.PP
\fB\-version\fR Displays version\&.

.PP
\fB\-debug\fR Enables extra debug output\&.

.PP
\fB\-q\fR Quiet mode, minimal output\&.

.PP
\fB\-verify\fR Verifies certificate to make proxy for\&.

.PP
\fB\-pwstdin\fR Allows passphrase from stdin\&.

.PP
\fB\-limited\fR Creates a limited proxy\&.

.PP
\fB\-hours\fR  \fIH\fR Proxy is valid for H hours (default:12)\&.

.PP
\fB\-vomslife\fR  \fIH\fR Tries to get an AC with information valid for H hours\&. The default is "as long as the proxy certificate"\&. The special value 0 means as long as the server will allow\&.

.PP
\fB\-bits\fR  \fIB\fR Number of bits in key {512|1024|2048|4096}

.PP
\fB\-cert\fR  \fIcertfile\fR Non\-standard location of user certificate

.PP
\fB\-key\fR  \fIkeyfile\fR Non\-standard location of user key

.PP
\fB\-certdir\fR  \fIcertdir\fR Location of trusted certificates dir

.PP
\fB\-out\fR  \fIproxyfile\fR Location of new proxy cert

.PP
\fB\-voms\fR  \fIvoms[:command]\fR Specifies the fake VOMS server that will appear in the attribute certificate\&. command is ignored and is present for compatibility with voms\-proxy\-init\&.

.PP
\fB\-include\fR  \fIfile\fR Includes file in the certificate (in a non critical extension)

.PP
\fB\-conf\fR  \fIfile\fR Read options from file\&.

.PP
\fB\-policy\fR The file containing the policy expression\&.

.PP
\fB\-policy\-language\fR\fI pl\fR The language in which the policy is expressed\&. Default is IMPERSONATION_PROXY\&.

.PP
\fB\-path\-length\fR Maximum depth of proxy certfificate that can be signed from this\&.

.PP
\fB\-globus\fR  \fIversion\fR Underlying Globus version\&.

.PP
\fB\-proxyver\fR Version of the proxy certificate to create\&. May be 2 or 3\&. Default value is decided upon underlying globus version\&.

.PP
\fB\-separate\fR  \fIfile\fR Saves the voms credential on file file\&.

.PP
\fB\-hostcert\fR  \fIfile\fR The cert that will be used to sign the AC\&.

.PP
\fB\-hostkey\fR  \fIfile\fR The key thet will be used to sign the AC\&.

.PP
\fB\-fqan\fR  \fIfile\fR The string that will be included in the AC as the granted FQAN\&.

.PP
\fB\-newformat\fR

.PP
This forces the server to generate ACs in the new (correct) format\&. This is meant as a compatibility feature to ease migration while the servers upgrade to the new version\&.

.PP
\fB\-newsubject\fR  \fInewdn\fR

.PP
The created proxy will have newdn as subject rather than what is would normally have depending on the specific version of proxy created\&.

.PP
\fB\-newserial\fR  \fInewserial\fR

.PP
The created proxy will have the newserial as its serial number\&. The new serial number will have to be specified as an hex representation\&. Any length is possible\&. If this option is not specified, voms\-proxy\-fake will choose the serial number\&.

.PP
\fB\-pastac\fR  \fItimespec\fR

.PP
The created AC will have its validity start in the past, as specified by timespec\&.

.PP
The format of timespec is one of: seconds, hours:minutes, hours:minutes:seconds

.PP
\fB\-pastproxy\fR  \fItimespec\fR

.PP
The created proxy will have its validity start in the past as specified by timespec

.PP
The format of timespec is one of: seconds, hours:minutes, hours:minutes:seconds

.PP
\fB\-nscert\fR  \fIbit,\&.\&.\&.,bit\fR

.PP
The created proxy will have the specified bits in the Netscape Certificate Extension\&. Acceptable values for bit are: client, server, email, objsign, sslCA, emailCA, objCA\&. The default value is not to have this extension\&.

.PP
\fB\-extkeyusage\fR  \fIbit,\&.\&.\&.,bit\fR

.PP
The created proxy will have the specified bits in the Extended Key Usage Extension\&. Acceptable values for bit are: serverAuth, clientAuth, codeSigning, emailProtection, timeStamping, msCodeInd, msCodeCom, msCTLSign, msSGC, msEFS, nsSGC, deltaCRL\&. The default value is not to have this extensions\&.

.PP
\fB\-keyusage\fR  \fIbit,\&.\&.\&.,bit\fR

.PP
The created proxy will have the specified bits in the Key Usage Extensions\&. Acceptable values for bit are: digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment, keyAgreement, keyCertSign, cRLSign, encipherOnly, decipherOnly\&. The default value is to copy this extensions from the issuer certificate while removing the keyCertSign and nonRepudiation bits if present\&.

.PP
\fB\-selfsigned\fR

.PP
The created certificate will be a self\-signed certificate and have a CA=true bit in the Basic constraints Exception\&.

.PP
\fB\-extension\fR  \fIoid[/criticality]value\fR

.PP
This option allows to specified additional extensions to be put in the created certificate\&.

.PP
oid is the Object Identifier of the extensions\&. Any OID may be used even if it is not already known in advance\&. This must always be specified\&. There is no default\&.

.PP
criticality specifies whether the extensions is critical or not, and it must be either true or false\&. If absent, it defaults to false\&.

.PP
value is the value of the extensions\&. It is composed by two subfields, type and content\&. type is a single charater, and specifies how the content is interpreted\&. ':' means that content is a text string to be included as is\&. '~' means that content is an hex representation of the string\&. '+' means that content is the name of a file which will contain the actual data\&.

.PP
\fB\-acextension\fR  \fIoid[/criticality]value\fR

.PP
This option allows to specified additional extensions to be put in the created attribute certificate\&.

.PP
\fB\-voinfo\fR  \fIfile\fR

.PP
The file file contains informations for additional ACs that should be included in the created proxy\&. ACs specified via the \-voinfo option shall be added before ACs specified via the command line options\&.

.PP
The format of the file is the following:

.PP
